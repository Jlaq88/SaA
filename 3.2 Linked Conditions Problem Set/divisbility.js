// Create a variable, value, and set it to some Number



// Check if the number is divisible by 2 or not. If it is not divisible by 2, state the remainder.

// Check if the number is divisible by 3 or not. If it is not divisible by 3, state the remainder.

// Check if the number is divisible by 6 or not. If it is not divisible by 6, state the remainder.

// ***Challenge*** Can this be achieved with only the program executing only two comparisons for any given situation?
