    their answers (answerOne, answerTwo, answerThree).

    Create a program that prompts the user with the phrase (use the given variable). Compare their response with the answer
    (using the answer variable).  Using an if-statement let them know if they got each one.

    Use a counter variable to keep track of how many they got correct. Write the number of correct answers to the web page.
