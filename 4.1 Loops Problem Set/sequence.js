/* Sequence
 * Create a loop will print out a sequence that halves when its even and triples (plus one) if its odd.
 */

// Create a variable to store a positive, whole number.

// Loop while that number is not one.

    // Output the value

    // If it is even

        // the number will be half its original value

    // Otherwise

        // multiply it by 3 plus 1


// CHALLENGE: Happy/Sad Numbers
// Take a number from the user.  Find the sum of the squares of its digits. Check if that sum is 1.
// If the number is not one, repeat the process.  If the number has already come up, stop.  If the number is one stop.
// A happy number is a number that eventually gets to one. A sad number is a number that will never finish and it will
// eventually go into a repetitive pattern.
