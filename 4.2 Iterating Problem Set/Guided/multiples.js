/*  Multiples of nine
    This program will print out the multiples of nine up to 12 using a while loop and the following format:

    9 x {counter} = {multiple}
*/
"use strict";

// Create a counter variable starting at 0
let counter = 0;

while (counter <=12) {
    let multiple = 9;

    console.log(counter * multiple);

    counter = counter +1
}
if (counter > 12){
    console.log("Goodbye");

}
// Loop while the counter is less than or equal to 12

    // In a variable called multiple, store the multiple of nine

    // Print the output at described above

    // Increment the counter

// Say Good-by
