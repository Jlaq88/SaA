Create a program, starting with pseudo-code, that takes in a sentence and encrypts
it using the Caesar cipher. The encrypted message will be printed to the screen.

A Caesar cipher is a shifting cipher in that all letters the message are replaced
with the letter that is 5 characters to the right of the letter. It will wrap to
the front of the alphabet if it goes too far. For example,
cat! becomes hfy!

**Challenge**: Keep the shifted letters in the range of 48 to 122 so that it is always visible as keyboard characters
*/

// Get the message from user

// Use a cipher variable as an empty string

// Loop through each letter

    // Convert to a number (ASCII -> integer)

    // Add 5 to value

    // Turn the number back to a character (letter/number)

    // Add the scramble character to the cipher (secret message)

// Output the encrypted message
