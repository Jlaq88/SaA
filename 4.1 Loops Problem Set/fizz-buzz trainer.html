    // Loop while the user is playing

        // Prompt the user for their guess

        // Condition 1: Check if it is divisible by 5 and 7

             // If they didn't enter 'fizz buzz', isPlaying is false

        // Condition 2: Check if it is divisible by 5

            // If they didn't enter 'fizz', isPlaying is false

        // Condition 3: Check if it is divisible by 7

            // If they didn't enter 'buzz', isPlaying is false

        // Otherwise

            // If they didn't enter the correct number, isPlaying is false

    // *** CHALLENGE: Handle the extra cases where if the number contains a 5 or a 7 it should be fizz, buzz or fizz-buzz
