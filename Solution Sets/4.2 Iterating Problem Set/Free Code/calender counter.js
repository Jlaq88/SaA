Write a program that uses a while loop to print out the month, day of the week and day of your month.

The program will use values hard coded in (Current month, day and day of the week), as well as how many days to count
for.

The program will then iterate through day-by-day, as shown. Assume it is not a leap year.
    Hard coded inputs: 3 (March)  3 (day)   2 (Tuesday)
    Count for: 3 days

    Output:
    Tuesday, March 3
    Wednesday, March 4
    Thursday, March 5

*** CHALLENGE: Try to calculate if its a leap year or not
