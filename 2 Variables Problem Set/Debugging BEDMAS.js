These problems don't work. UNCOMMENT and fix them to get rid of errors by adding in math symbols so they
give the right answer.

1. You cannot delete any of the numbers or rearrange them.
2. There must be something between each number.

For example:
let example = 3 3 3; // You want the number 4
Solution:
let example = 3 + 3 / 3;  // Evaluates to 4
*/

//let result_A = 6 2 1 2; // You want the integer 6
//console.log(result_A);

//let result_B = 4 4 4 4  // You want the float 3.0
//console.log(result_B);

//let result_C = 1 4 1 4  // You want the output 1414
//console.log(result_C);
